I go to the gym consistently with my cousin during the evening, but sometimes, my cousin likes to go a little earlier. Therefore, before going to the gym, I would need to text 
my cousin if we were still going to the gym together or not and vice versa which was a bit tedious. 

With that problem, I thought a solution would be to create a gym app created using ReactJS for the frontend and Django for the backend.

This app would allow the users to schedule their gym sessions with friends while also acting as a personal gym tracker that the user can use to track their progression in the gym.

Before trying to code and create the app, I did some planning before hand and created a prototype using figma. The link to the prototype is the following:

I also decided to create a class diagram displaying how my models behave and interact with each other so that it would be easier to understand my application.

This project is still in development, but the website is live and running. I intend to add update, deletion, and validation capabilities to the project. I will probably add more features like sending and accepting gym session invitations and more in the future.
